# IsoHelp

# Inspiration
With some of the team members having to self isolate several times due to travel restrictions, we acknowledged how difficult it must be to undergo self-isolation without having anyone help you with day-to-day tasks.

# What it does
The app lets users register as either a volunteer or as an isolating user. Users can submit tasks that they need help with. Volunteers pick tasks to complete and fulfill them.

# How we built it
We built it using android studio and collaborated using git.

# Challenges we ran into
Authentication, storing data in the database, implementing google APIs. The app doesn't fully work yet but it gives the general impression of how it should operate.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The design of the app, the general user experience.

# What we learned
We didn't have much android development experience, for several of us, this is actually our first android app. Because of that, we have learned a lot about android development from scratch.

# What's next for IsoHelp
Connecting users to volunteers, storing tasks properly, using maps to display locations, generally adding more functionalities.

# Built With
android-studio
firebase
google-APIs
java
